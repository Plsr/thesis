A list of interesting quotes found whilst doing my research. Those quotes may be of use later on, tease new topics or pinpoint a certain concept.

#### Vitaly Friedman on Whitespace: 
> When a new visitor approaches a design layout, the first thing he/she
tries to do is to scan the page and divide the content area into digestible pieces of information.
Complex structures are harder to read, scan, analyze and work with. If you have the choice
between separating two design segments by a visible line or by some whitespace, it’s usually
better to use the whitespace solution.Hierarchical structures reduce complexity (Simon’s Law):
the better you manage to provide users with a sense of visual hierarchy, the easier your
content will be to perceive.
