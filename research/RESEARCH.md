### [Interactive Genetic Algorithms for User Interface Design](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4424630/)

#### Summary
* Use Genetic algorithms to help lowering user fatigue (by building interfaces in the XUL Interface language). 
* Fitness of individual calculated based on combination of user input and design guidelines.
* User only chooses best and worst solution from a subset of nine proposals one every _t_ generations (_t_ was varied)
* First step in the field, there is ambition to improve on the findings of the study

#### Critique
* Widgets are judged objectively only based on color
* Were the users designers? How good was the individual input?
* The end UIs still don't look good.
* Focus rather on  reducing user fatigue than building a UI with algorithms which shows in the end results (UIs do not look good at all)
