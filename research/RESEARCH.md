### [Interactive Genetic Algorithms for User Interface Design](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4424630/)

#### Summary
* Use Genetic algorithms to help lowering user fatigue (by building interfaces in the XUL Interface language). 
* Fitness of individual calculated based on combination of user input and design guidelines.
* User only chooses best and worst solution from a subset of nine proposals one every _t_ generations (_t_ was varied)
* First step in the field, there is ambition to improve on the findings of the study

#### Critique
* Widgets are judged objectively only based on color
* Were the users designers? How good was the individual input?
* The end UIs still don't look good.
* Focus rather on  reducing user fatigue than building a UI with algorithms which shows in the end results (UIs do not look good at all)

### [Successful User Interface Design from Efficient Computer Algorithms](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.27.2962&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
#### Summary
* The user interface was considered as a data structure and a better structure was built with the help of algorithms
* Users would navigate through the functions of the device by typing the names of functions with the number keys of the device and selecting the matching one from the results.
* User preferred the new design
* The new design was measured as more performant

#### Critique
* As the experiment is rather old (2000), the UI was textual rather than graphical. For the purpose of my thesis its not that helpful.
* It’s at least a use case where someone combined design and algorithms, even if not in the way I’m looking for.
